= Jiffy Overview =

Jiffy is an end-to-end real-world web page instrumentation and measurement suite.

Jiffy allows developers to 

  * measure individual pieces of page rendering (script load, AJAX execution, page load, etc.) on every client
  * report those measurements and other metadata to a web server
  * aggregate web server logs into a database
  * generate reports 

Additionally, using Bill Scott's [http://billwscott.com/jiffyext/ Jiffy extension for Firebug], developers can see and test Jiffy-based measurements.

Currently we provide the following components:

  * Jiffy.js, the Javascript library used for generating measurements; it's tested across IE6 & 7, FF2 & 3, and Safari 3.
  * Apache proxy (httpd.conf) configuration for logging Jiffy posts
  * An ingestor (written in Perl) which runs on the Apache server and posts logs to a database through DBI
  * Working DDLs for Oracle & MySQL
  * Reporting rollup code for Oracle (MySQL to come)
  * A reporting UI using the Yahoo! User Interface library
