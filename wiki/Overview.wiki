= Jiffy Overview =

Jiffy-web is a fine-grained and flexible website performance tracking and analysis suite. It includes mechanisms to measure execution time of certain browser events as well as elements designated by the web author. This ability allows for real world client times be then be sent back to a server to log each one of these measures. It is then possible to generate reports based on the data gathered from the clients viewing your page. 

Currently we are using an Apache proxy to take all requests to /rx and store them in standard Apache logs. We then have an ingestion script written in Perl that will take these logs parse them and insert to the DB. We are currently using Oracle but we do have a DDL for MySQL.
