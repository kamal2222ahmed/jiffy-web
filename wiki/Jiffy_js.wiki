The jiffy.js file is the core of measuring marks within the page on the client and sending them back to the server for logging. 


= JiffyParams =
JiffyParams is a globally scoped hash that needs to be declared before the jiffy.js file is included. This hash has three main settings required for Jiffy to function.

*jsStart*: This is the start time we will measure all marks back to. It is important to make sure that this is at the top most place in your page.<br>
*uid*: This is a unique ID that will be used in reporting to link all measures together as a single page.<br>
*pname*: The name of the page you are measuring. This is used mostly for reporting.

example:<br>
{{{
<script type="text/javascript">
  var JiffyParams = {
     jsStart: (new Date()).getTime(),
     uid: <xsl:value-of select="/page/settings/random" />,
     pname: '<xsl:value-of select="$pagename" />'
  }
</script>
}}}
