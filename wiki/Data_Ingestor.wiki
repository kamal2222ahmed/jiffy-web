The ingestion script is written in Perl and currently requires one non-core module, DBI (DBI is licensed differently then Jiffy).

The script can be run as a CRON job to ingest the Apache logs into the data store. It is setup to accept and parse both the on demand measures and the batch measures. The format for these two types of log entries look like the following:

*bulk:*
172.25.1.161 [13/Jun/2008:14:39:24 -0700] "?uid=13304334331213393192942&st=1213393192942&pn=PERS_RESULTS_1&ets=scriptDone:46,bannerDone:15,load:1625"

*on-demand:*
172.25.1.161 [13/Jun/2008:14:39:24 -0700] "?uid=13304334331213393192942&st=1213393192942&pn=PERS_RESULTS_1&ets=scriptDone:46"
